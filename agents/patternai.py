def detect_patterns(symbol: str, tf: str, candles: list) -> dict:
    """
    Detects chart patterns based on OHLC candle data.
    Currently returns a dummy pattern. This is where advanced pattern recognition
    algorithms (e.g., using TA-Lib or custom logic) would be integrated.

    Parameters:
        symbol (str): Trading pair symbol (e.g., XAU/USD).
        tf (str): Timeframe (e.g., 1min).
        candles (list): List of OHLC candles, from oldest to newest.

    Returns:
        dict: A dictionary containing detected pattern and its confidence.
              Example: {"pattern": "Bullish Engulfing", "confidence": 0.82}
                       {"pattern": "No Specific Pattern", "confidence": 0.0}
    """
    if not candles or len(candles) < 5: # Need enough candles to detect patterns
        return {"pattern": "No Specific Pattern", "confidence": 0.0}

    # --- Placeholder for actual pattern detection logic ---
    # In a real scenario, you would analyze the 'candles' data here.
    # For example, using a library like TA-Lib:
    # import talib
    # closes = np.array([float(c['close']) for c in candles])
    # opens = np.array([float(c['open']) for c in candles])
    # highs = np.array([float(c['high']) for c in candles])
    # lows = np.array([float(c['low']) for c in candles])

    # if talib.CDLENGULFING(opens, highs, lows, closes)[-1] != 0:
    #     return {"pattern": "Engulfing Pattern", "confidence": 0.75}
    # -----------------------------------------------------

    # For now, let's return a simple dummy pattern based on a very basic condition
    # This can be made more sophisticated later.
    last_close = float(candles[-1]['close'])
    second_last_close = float(candles[-2]['close'])

    if last_close > second_last_close * 1.005: # If price increased by more than 0.5% in last candle
        return {"pattern": "Strong Upward Momentum", "confidence": 0.65}
    elif last_close < second_last_close * 0.995: # If price decreased by more than 0.5% in last candle
        return {"pattern": "Strong Downward Momentum", "confidence": 0.65}
    else:
        return {"pattern": "No Specific Pattern", "confidence": 0.0}
